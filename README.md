1. Binary Array Sorting-

    Input: 
            5
            1 0 1 1 0
    Output:
            0 0 1 1 1
            
2.  Sum of numbers in string

    Input:
         str = abc12yu8it4
    Output: 24
    
    Explanation: 1 and 23 are numbers in the string which is added to get the sum as 24.

3. check for sum of pair in array

   arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}
   
   sum = 0
   
   Input: 1 -2 1 0 5
          0
          
   Output: Array doesnt have two elements with the given sum     Explaination:(No valid pair exists.)

4. Sum of all nodes present in binary tree

             15
            /  \
           6    8
               / \
              3   4
        o/p- 36
              
5. Print the index values of pair which meets the target
     i/p- array:  [3,4,11,7]
         
          target:   7
        
     o/p-  0 1    (3+4=7)
